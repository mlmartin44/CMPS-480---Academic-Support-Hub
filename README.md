# CMPS-480---Academic-Support-Hub
TO use for the CMPS 480 Senior Project 

# Academic Support Hub

A platform where students can:
- Find study groups by course/major
- Access approved study materials
- Participate in peer-to-peer Q&A
- Use a built-in planner for assignments and deadlines

---

## Branches
- `main` → stable production-ready code
- `dev` → integration branch (merge feature branches here first)

## Team Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from `dev`
2. Commit & push your changes to your branch
3. Open a Pull Request → merge into `dev`
4. Instructor-ready releases → merge `dev` into `main`

## Outcome
1. A full functioning tool for students that executes all of the above.
