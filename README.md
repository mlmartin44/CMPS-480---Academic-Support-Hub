Access approved study materials
Participate in peer-to-peer Q&A
Use a built-in planner for assignments and deadlines
Branches
main → stable production-ready code

Team Workflow
Create a feature branch from dev
Commit & push your changes to your branch
Open a Pull Request → merge into dev
Instructor-ready releases → merge dev into main
