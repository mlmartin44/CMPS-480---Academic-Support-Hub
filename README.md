**Team Members:**
- Mariah Martin
- Ethan
- Brandon

## Overview

The **Academic Support Hub (ASH)** is a web platform designed to help Point Park University students connect academically through:

- **Study Groups** — Join or create groups by course or major  
- **Q&A Forum** — Ask and answer peer questions  
- **Resource Hub** — Upload and share study materials  
- **Planner & Calendar Sync** — Track assignments and deadlines  

This assignment focuses on **customer discovery** — testing assumptions about student needs and validating whether ASH addresses real problems.  
Each team member interviewed **three students** and recorded their findings.

## Hypotheses

| # | Hypothesis | Rationale |
|:-:|:------------|:-----------|
| 1 | Commuter and busy students struggle to connect and collaborate with peers. | Many students only come to campus for classes or work. |
| 2 | Students want organized, reliable tools for forming and managing study groups. | Group chats and messaging apps are unstructured and cluttered. |
| 3 | Students would use a Q&A feature to get faster help on class topics. | They lack a dedicated space for course-specific discussion. |
| 4 | Resource sharing is valuable when it’s course-specific and trusted. | Students want peer-verified study materials. |
| 5 | A planner or calendar sync would save time and improve engagement. | Students currently enter assignments manually. |

## Mariah

### Interview 1: Shay (Junior, Business Administration, Commuter)
- Works full-time and is only on campus for classes.  
- Finds it difficult to maintain consistent study partners.  
- Uses Canvas for coursework but not for collaboration.  
- Wants reminders and virtual study meet-up options.  

> “I’d like a space to see if others from my classes want to study together, but I don’t have time to hang around campus hoping to run into people.”

**Validated:** #1, #5  

---

### Interview 2: Amaris (Graduate, International Studies)
- Relied on Canvas and PointWeb but felt disconnected.  
- Wanted to see what resources other students found helpful.  
- Found Canvas discussion boards unhelpful and outdated.  

> “Sometimes you just want to know what helped other students get through a tough class.”

**Validated:** #2, #3

### Interview 3: Ghaith (Sophomore, Computer Science, Commuter)
- Interested in certain technical areas but struggles with unfamiliar topics.  
- Rarely connects with other students outside of class.  
- Wants a PPU-only Q&A platform to view others’ questions and solutions.  

> “It’d be nice to see what questions others are asking in the same class — like a PPU-only Stack Overflow.”

**Validated:** #1, #2, #3, #5  

---

#### Reflection
Doing these interviews showed me how students with different majors all share similar challenges in staying connected and supported academically. Commuters like Shay and Ghaith need flexible online tools to engage with peers, while graduates like Amaris emphasized the value of shared resources and academic discussions. I learned that ASH can make a real difference by providing a space where students can connect, collaborate, and find help regardless of their schedules. These insights confirmed that our focus on accessibility, communication, and shared learning is exactly what students need.

## Ethan

### Interview 1: Ramon (Accounting Major, Baseball Player)
- Busy schedule with practices and games.  
- Finds group chats unorganized and distracting.  
- Wants study groups organized by class and available times.  

**Validated:** #1, #2  

---

### Interview 2: Harold (Sports Management Major, Baseball Player)
- Time management is his biggest challenge.  
- Needs a tool that allows him to see when others are free and sends reminders.  
- Likes the idea of course-specific group tabs.  

**Validated:** #1, #2, #5  

---

### Interview 3: Javi (Education Major, Parent Student)
- Balances family responsibilities with coursework.  
- Needs reliable, organized groups with defined topics.  
- Appreciates dedicated tabs for each class.  

**Validated:** #1, #2  

---

#### Reflection
Doing these interviews helped me understand what students need instead of just assuming. I learned that time and scheduling are the biggest challenges, especially for students with busy lives like athletes or those with families. Talking to Ramon and Harold, they showed me how hard it is to balance sports and academics, as I was just in their shoes the past two years and Javi showed how family responsibilities make time even more limited. I realized that our platform needs to be organized, easy to navigate, and clear about what each study session is for because these three individuals are not the only ones with busy lives there are plenty more out there that would appreciate a better organized platform. The interviews confirmed that having group specific tabs and scheduling tools will help users stay on track.

## Brandon

### Interview 1: Sarah (Senior)
- Shares notes occasionally but prefers control and recognition.  
- Would use a Q&A feature to reinforce her learning.  
- Suggested badges or expert recognition to encourage participation.  

**Validated:** #3, #4  

---

### Interview 2: Ben (Junior)
- Uses Google Calendar but finds it tedious to manage coursework manually.  
- Wants coursework displayed in one centralized space.  
- Would use ASH’s planner and study-group features to save time.  

**Validated:** #2, #5

### Interview 3: Mia (Sophomore)
- Struggled to find help before a major test.  
- Needs quick access to study groups and course-specific resources.  
- Likes the idea of searching by class or topic.  

**Validated:** #2, #3, #4  

---

#### Reflection
These interviews helped me understand that the main challenge that students experiencing is to get accurate knowledge and assistance in the timeframe they need it. They often only have a day or two to prepare for exams and other coursework and they can struggle to find information that directly applies to their coursework.
